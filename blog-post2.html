                    <p>When considering data threats in the workplace, the first things that typically come to mind are compromised hardware and inattentive employees. These threat scenarios can occur when data is at rest or in use and they are an underlying root cause for most security breaches that occur each year. There are, however, three states of data, the previous two scenarios occur with data stored on a device or backup medium with data in motion serving as the third state. The first form of data in motion is <b><u>information that flows over the public or an untrusted network</u></b> like the Internet, while the second is <b><u>data that flows through the confines of a private network such as a corporate or enterprise local area network (LAN)</u></b>.</p>
                    <p>Despite the widespread threat exposure for data-in-motion, there are few organizations that actively focus on protecting it. Those companies that do use a traditional network security approach that is flawed, outdated and overpriced. In response, <b><em>Privafy Security Services</em></b> has the singular goal of protecting data-in-motion by creating a more secure experience for enterprises using data in the cloud and internet.</p>
                    <p>When building its platform Privafy focused on three primary objectives. The first was to create a <b><u>comprehensive, full-stack integrated solution</u></b>. The second was to make it <b><u>affordable</u></b>, literally costing a fraction of other legacy solutions. The final objective was to <b><u>make it easy to use</u></b>, which was accomplished with a web-based administration feature that allows non-cybersecurity professionals to self-provision and self-manage the platform.</p>
                    <p>The complete platform is comprised of three components – CloudEdge, AppEdge and NetEdge; each of which provides a unique capability to protect data-in-motion:</p>

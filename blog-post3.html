                    <p>Companies can protect employees from phishing schemes through a combination of training, secure email gateways and filtering technologies. But what protects workers from phone-based voice phishing (vishing) scams, like the kind that recently targeted <b><em>GoDaddy</em></b> and a group of cryptocurrency platforms that use the Internet domain registrar service?</p>
                    <p>Experts indicate that there are few easy answers, but organizations intent on putting a stop to such activity may have to push for more secure forms of verification, escalation procedures for sensitive requests, and better security awareness of account support staffers and other lower-level employees.</p>
                    <p>According to a report by security expert <b><em>Brian Krebs</em></b>, scammers called up GoDaddy posing as <b>representatives of legitimate cryptocurrency platforms</b>, and tricked employees of the internet domain registrar into changing account information so that email and web traffic intended for these platforms would instead be directed to attacker-controlled domains.</p>
                    <p>Experts warn that live social engineering calls are especially difficult to suss out, especially because there isnâ€™t time to notice suspicious behavior in the middle of a conversation, and perpetrators are often very convincing.</p>

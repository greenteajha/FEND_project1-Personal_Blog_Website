                    <p>A Thanksgiving turkey must be carefully prepared and cooked in just the right way, lest it come out too dry or undercooked. Similarly, your cloud assets should also be configured properly if they’re going to be secure.</p>
                    <p><b><em>Lightspin</em></b>, a new Israeli-based cybersecurity startup, has emerged from stealth this week to tackle the latter problem, securing <b><u>$4 million</u></b> in initial seed funding from Ibex Investors and other private angel investors. The company uses graph-based tools and algorithms to analyze the security posture of an organization’s cloud stack, identifying misconfigurations or problematic permission policies in order plot out the most likely avenues of attack.                </p>
                    <p>In a statement, <b><em>Ibex Investors Vice President Nicole Priel</em></b> said investors saw promise in Lightspin’s effort to tackle security problems “that are often missed or not managed by cloud providers and other solutions.”                </p>
                    <p>“We see great added value in Lightspin’s approach to addressing these critical, yet often overlooked aspects of cloud security, particularly as the future of innovation becomes increasingly dependent on cloud capabilities, and threat actors simultaneously become more sophisticated,” said Priel.                </p>
